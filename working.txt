1. Graph Representation
The metro network is represented as a graph using an adjacency list, where:

Each station (node) is a key in a HashMap.
The value for each key is a list of Edge objects representing connections to other stations and their respective weights (distance or time).
java
Copy code
private Map<String, List<Edge>> metroMap = new HashMap<>();
2. Adding Stations
The addStation method ensures a station is added to the graph. If a station already exists, it does nothing.

java
Copy code
public void addStation(String station) {
    metroMap.putIfAbsent(station, new ArrayList<>());
}
3. Adding Connections
The addConnection method adds a bidirectional connection between two stations. Each connection is represented by an Edge object containing the target station and the weight.

java
Copy code
public void addConnection(String from, String to, int weight) {
    metroMap.get(from).add(new Edge(to, weight));
    metroMap.get(to).add(new Edge(from, weight)); // Bidirectional
}
4. Finding the Shortest Route
The Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented in the findShortestRoute method:

Initialization:

A distances map tracks the shortest distance from the start to each station.
A previous map tracks the previous station in the shortest path.
A PriorityQueue processes stations in order of their current shortest distance.
Relaxation:

For each station, the algorithm checks its neighbors and updates their shortest distance if a shorter path is found.
The neighbor is added back to the queue with its updated distance.
Path Reconstruction:

The path is backtracked from the destination to the start using the previous map.
java
Copy code
public List<String> findShortestRoute(String start, String destination) {
    Map<String, Integer> distances = new HashMap<>();
    Map<String, String> previous = new HashMap<>();
    PriorityQueue<Edge> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(edge -> edge.weight));

    for (String station : metroMap.keySet()) {
        distances.put(station, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }
    distances.put(start, 0);
    pq.add(new Edge(start, 0));

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        Edge current = pq.poll();
        String currentStation = current.node;

        for (Edge edge : metroMap.get(currentStation)) {
            int newDistance = distances.get(currentStation) + edge.weight;
            if (newDistance < distances.get(edge.node)) {
                distances.put(edge.node, newDistance);
                previous.put(edge.node, currentStation);
                pq.add(new Edge(edge.node, newDistance));
            }
        }
    }

    List<String> route = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String at = destination; at != null; at = previous.get(at)) {
        route.add(at);
    }
    Collections.reverse(route);

    if (route.size() == 1 && !route.get(0).equals(start)) {
        return Collections.emptyList(); // No route found
    }
    return route;
}
5. Menu-Driven Interaction
The main method provides an interactive menu where users can:

Find the shortest route between two stations.
Exit the program.
The menu uses a Scanner to read user input. It validates the stations and displays the shortest route or an error message.

java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    MetroShortestRoute metro = new MetroShortestRoute();

    // Predefined metro network
    metro.addStation("A");
    metro.addStation("B");
    metro.addStation("C");
    metro.addStation("D");
    metro.addConnection("A", "B", 5);
    metro.addConnection("A", "C", 10);
    metro.addConnection("B", "D", 15);
    metro.addConnection("C", "D", 5);

    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    while (true) {
        System.out.println("\n--- Metro Route Finder ---");
        System.out.println("1. Find Shortest Route");
        System.out.println("2. Exit");
        System.out.print("Select an option: ");

        int choice = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline

        if (choice == 1) {
            System.out.print("Enter the start station: ");
            String start = scanner.nextLine();
            System.out.print("Enter the destination station: ");
            String destination = scanner.nextLine();

            if (!metro.metroMap.containsKey(start) || !metro.metroMap.containsKey(destination)) {
                System.out.println("Invalid stations. Please try again.");
                continue;
            }

            List<String> route = metro.findShortestRoute(start, destination);

            if (route.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.println("No route found between " + start + " and " + destination + ".");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Shortest route: " + String.join(" -> ", route));
            }
        } else if (choice == 2) {
            System.out.println("Exiting... Goodbye!");
            break;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid option. Please try again.");
        }
    }

    scanner.close();
}
6. Edge Class
The Edge class is a helper class representing connections between stations.

java
Copy code
static class Edge {
    String node;
    int weight;

    Edge(String node, int weight) {
        this.node = node;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
}

Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is used in this program to find the shortest route between two stations. Let's break down how it implements Dijkstra's algorithm in the findShortestRoute method.

Steps in Dijkstra's Algorithm
Initialization:

All nodes (stations) are initialized with a distance of infinity (Integer.MAX_VALUE), except the start node, which is set to 0.
A PriorityQueue is used to store and process nodes based on their shortest known distance.
A previous map is used to reconstruct the shortest path after the algorithm finishes.
In the code:

java
Copy code
Map<String, Integer> distances = new HashMap<>();
Map<String, String> previous = new HashMap<>();
PriorityQueue<Edge> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(edge -> edge.weight));

for (String station : metroMap.keySet()) {
    distances.put(station, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
}
distances.put(start, 0);
pq.add(new Edge(start, 0));
Processing Nodes:

The algorithm repeatedly extracts the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.
For each neighbor of the current node, it calculates a new tentative distance:
new distance
=
distance to current node
+
edge weight to neighbor
new distance=distance to current node+edge weight to neighbor
If the new distance is shorter than the currently known distance to the neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.
In the code:

java
Copy code
while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
    Edge current = pq.poll();
    String currentStation = current.node;

    for (Edge edge : metroMap.get(currentStation)) {
        int newDistance = distances.get(currentStation) + edge.weight;
        if (newDistance < distances.get(edge.node)) {
            distances.put(edge.node, newDistance);
            previous.put(edge.node, currentStation);
            pq.add(new Edge(edge.node, newDistance));
        }
    }
}
Reconstructing the Shortest Path:

Once all nodes are processed, the shortest path to the destination is reconstructed by backtracking through the previous map.
If no path exists, the result is an empty list.
In the code:

java
Copy code
List<String> route = new ArrayList<>();
for (String at = destination; at != null; at = previous.get(at)) {
    route.add(at);
}
Collections.reverse(route);

if (route.size() == 1 && !route.get(0).equals(start)) {
    return Collections.emptyList(); // No route found
}
return route;
Why This is Dijkstra's Algorithm
Priority Queue:

The priority queue ensures that the station with the currently smallest distance is processed first, which is a hallmark of Dijkstra's algorithm.
Distance Updates:

Each time a shorter path to a station is found, the algorithm updates the distance and adds the station back into the priority queue.
Greedy Approach:

The algorithm uses a greedy strategy by always expanding the node with the smallest known distance.
Limitations
Dijkstra's algorithm assumes non-negative edge weights. If your metro system has negative weights (e.g., cost savings), you’d need a different algorithm like Bellman-Ford.
Example Flow in the Program
Given the predefined network:

mathematica
Copy code
Stations: A, B, C, D
Connections: 
    A --5--> B
    A --10--> C
    B --15--> D
    C --5--> D
If the user selects A as the start and D as the destination:

Initial distances: {A: 0, B: ∞, C: ∞, D: ∞}
Processing A: Updates distances to B (5) and C (10).
Processing B: Updates distance to D (20) (via A -> B).
Processing C: Updates distance to D (15) (via A -> C).
Final distances: {A: 0, B: 5, C: 10, D: 15}
Path reconstructed: A -> C -> D.
Result:

Copy code
Shortest route: A -> C -> D
